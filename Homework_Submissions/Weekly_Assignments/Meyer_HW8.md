2.5/3: Good job. I took of 0.5 because your graphs were missing from your write up. Let me know if you have any questions on how to get images in your markdown and I'm happy to help you do this. 

- I would be happy to help you with this issue if you come to my office hours. Did our discussion of multi-indexes from class last week help at all or was that not really addressing your question. 

#### Written Assignment
My week 1 forecast is 94.99 cfs and my week 2 forecast is 111.83 cfs.

The two graphs I created were the climatological trends of the streamflow from 1991 to 2020. The top graph is the week 1 outlook and the bottom graph is the week 2 outlook. Each graph has the climatological mean for the week forecast, respectively, and then they each also have a horizontal line indicating my forecasts given that we are enduring a drought currently. 

I am currently really struggling with pandas and how to combine multiple dataframes. I am encountering several issues while attempting to figure it out such as a double header, and while I can delete one of these, I am unable to rename the one that is left, thus, rendering a majority of plotting with errors. I am vastly confused on how to create new dataframes or combine dataframes while keeping the index intact.
