My week 1 forecast is 94.99 cfs and my week 2 forecast is 111.83 cfs.

The two graphs I created were the climatological trends of the streamflow from 1991 to 2020. The top graph is the week 1 outlook and the bottom graph is the week 2 outlook. Each graph has the climatological mean for the week forecast, respectively, and then they each also have a horizontal line indicating my forecasts given that we are enduring a drought currently. 

I am currently really struggling with pandas and how to combine multiple dataframes. I am encountering several issues while attempting to figure it out such as a double header, and while I can delete one of these, I am unable to rename the one that is left, thus, rendering a majority of plotting with errors. I am vastly confused on how to create new dataframes or combine dataframes while keeping the index intact.
