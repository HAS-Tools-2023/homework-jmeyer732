*This week we hit pause on new material and are working on exercises to review the skills we have learned so far.* 
____
**Assignment**

***1. Complete all of the Tuesday and Thursday exercises and submit your answers in a single python script.***

Submitted :)

***2. Write a short markdown reflecting on (1) What you learned, (2) things you still find confusing or couldn't solve.***

(1) I learned how to plot scatter plots much better and how to fill the plot. I had more practice reading in different forms of data and create some functions. I also learned more about setting up environments and what certain functions do/what warnings mean (thank you!)

(2) I am still confused on functions quite a bit. I dont understand the syntax or when to use what within the function. I also was able to fill in the plot, but I do not understand what each argument means wihin the function.


***3. Submit your forecast to the forecast repo following our standard procedures.***

Submitted! :)
