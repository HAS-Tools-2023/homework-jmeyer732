3/3: Excellent work this semester. I'm so glad that you found it useful and that you have already found ways to apply this in your other classes. Thanks also for your suggestions for next semester. 

**i. What were your favorite (or most useful) topics we covered?**

My favorite topics that we covered were Xarray and Matplotlib, I have found them extremely useful for all of my courses already. I also really enjoy how easy pandas is to use and how efficient it is. 

**ii. What did we not cover that you wished we had gotten to?**

I do wish we had gotten to Xarray earlier and using APIs so I did not use up so much space with data. I also think covering online data storage would be a great topic to minimize the amount of used local storage, but that may just be me since I have to use so many large files.

**iii. Are you happy with how far you have progressed over the course of the semester?**

I am really happy with how far I have progressed. I utilized tons of coding throughout the semester from this course, for all my other courses (which was difficult but extremely enjoyable). Being 'hands on' and immersing myself in python for almost every assignment I could was frustrating but I have gained so much knowledge and practice throughout the process. Thank you!!

**iv. Any suggestions you have for next year's class?**

I believe my only suggestions would be the online file storage and possibly establishing a group chat at the beginning of the semester. The individuals that were apart of the chat found it help and utilized it as a resource for help if they were stuck, however, a majority of the class never joined or even knew about the chat. Specifically, the undergraduates were unaware because d2l only shows the classlist of those registered within your section, i.e. i could only email other graduate students and no way to contact the undergraduates about the chat :(
