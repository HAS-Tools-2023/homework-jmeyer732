3/3 nice work. 
- Note no question 2.  THe matrix is a single 2-d array not a matrix composed of multiple arrays. 
- Exercise 3.1 tripped a lot of people up we'll talk about it more. Short answer is that np.random is a module and has multiple functions as part of it.

#### Question 1 - Quantitative Analysis and Prediction Explanation
      Since a majority of the southwest is experiencing a drought, I am estimating a week 1 streamflow of 50 cfs and a week 2 streamflow of 40 cfs. This is supported by my calculations because the unprecidented drought we are currently experiencing across the United States is recording all time lows. The streamflow was greater than my guess of 50 cfs during september 100% of the time prior to 2001 and approximately 98.5% of the time after 1999. I really did not understand how to plot different histograms with the new data.

#### Question 2 - flow_data
##### Describe the variable:
      A matrix of data composed of several different arrays based on the value from the text document including the year, month, day, and the streamflow in cubic feet per second. 
##### Type of data:
      The data is made up of floats.
##### Dimensions and Size:
      The matrix is 12,660 rows by 4 columns. It includes 50,640 float values. 

#### Question 3 - 1981 to current
      The flow was greater than my prediction (50 cfs) 1017 times during the month of september, or 98.93 percent of the september values.

#### Question 4
##### Prior to year 2001
      The flow was greater then my prediction (50 cfs) 390 times during the month of september, or 100% of the time, prior to 2001.
##### After year 1999
      The flow was greater than  my prediction (50 cfs) 717 times during the month of september, or 98.49% of the time, after 1999.

#### Question 5
      The flow generally decreases from the first half of september to the second half of september.

#### Question 6
      I am having trouble with exercise 3.1 because I dont understand how you can use .random and .randint within the same method, and I was unsure how to plot the two histograms required for question one of this homework.
