The streamflow values are very low even with the moderate precipitation in northwest Arizona, which I expect to 
increase values a bit for a few days as the precipitation flows downstream. However, values are still considerably 
low compared to what is expected based upon the long-term average of the stream gauge. Additionally, the majority 
of Arizona is in a drought, with GFS forecasting height anomalies that are significantly higher than the seasonal 
averages, likely worsening the drought. Additionally, the areas north of the Verde River gauge seem to be in either 
the left entrance region or right exit region of several upper-level moderate jet streaks, leading to descending dry 
air and more warming. Thus, I expect the streamflow to decrease significantly over the next two weeks, with only a 
moderate increase in flow for a few days initially, followed by a significant decrease. The very end of week 1 or 
midway through week 2 may set an all-time low record for this streamflow gauge.
