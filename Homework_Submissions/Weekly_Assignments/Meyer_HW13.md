**1. A reflection on what you changed from the last version to this one, and where you think your code could use some improvement.**

I changed how I wrote comments and sectioned lines, as well as my functions to make them more cumulative. I definitely think that my functions could use some improvement, however, I am just now really understanding them and writing them decently. I also removed a lot of the commented out functions per your feedback within my initial submissions.

**2. A reflection on how chatGPT improved your code and if you found it useful.**

ChatGPT did not improve my actual code much but it did improve my doc strings. It provided more in depth explanations than I initially did within my rough draft. I find ChatGPT very useful but the suggestions are nearly identical to what I planned, making it rather similar. I also put in a ton of effort for my functions within my roughdraft before attempting to use chatGPT, and fortunately, it did not have many suggestions.
