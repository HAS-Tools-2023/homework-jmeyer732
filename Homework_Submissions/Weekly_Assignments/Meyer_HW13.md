9/9 - Great job on your script! Really nice use of functions and its great how you have it so that I can change the forecast date and it all updates automatically. 

I left you some comments in the code for how to simplify things. The biggest thing you could do to simplify your script would be to use datetime functionality so you don't have to figure out your forecast windows in such a complicated way and do so much date parsing. 

Another general thing that would be good to add would be so some print statements telling the person when they run it what dates are being forecasted and what data is being used. 

So glad the functions are starting to make some sense! Practice really does make perfect with this. 

Also hopefully you found it validating that what chat GPT suggested was already in line with what you were planing on doing :) 

**1. A reflection on what you changed from the last version to this one, and where you think your code could use some improvement.**

I changed how I wrote comments and sectioned lines, as well as my functions to make them more cumulative. I definitely think that my functions could use some improvement, however, I am just now really understanding them and writing them decently. I also removed a lot of the commented out functions per your feedback within my initial submissions.

**2. A reflection on how chatGPT improved your code and if you found it useful.**

ChatGPT did not improve my actual code much but it did improve my doc strings. It provided more in depth explanations than I initially did within my rough draft. I find ChatGPT very useful but the suggestions are nearly identical to what I planned, making it rather similar. I also put in a ton of effort for my functions within my roughdraft before attempting to use chatGPT, and fortunately, it did not have many suggestions.
