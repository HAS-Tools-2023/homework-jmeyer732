## Week 3 Homework
### Jessica Meyer

#### Definition List - Question 1
flow
: initially recognized as either objects or floats, the rate of water discharge at the gague location within the Verde River in cubic feet per second. Later to be identified as integers so numpy could recognize them and apply the code. Flow was 5 integers for this previous week with no data found for sept 8 or 9.

year, month, and day
: initially read as a string by python but later changed type to integer so the dataframe could be read using linear time values and have time associated with eah index value, thus, flow value.

#### Question 2
The daily flow was greater than my prediction on 4 occasions in September 2023, and greater than my prediction on 733 occasions in September since 1981. I did not understand the part about the percentage. I am unsure what you mean by percentage.

#### Question 3
 The daily flow was greater than my prediction on 315 occasions for 2010 or prior and greater than my prediction on 245 occasions from 2010 to current. I am unsure what you mean by percentage.

#### Question 4
The daily flow mean for the first half of september is slightly higher than the second half of september for the full record (1981-current). The standard deviation is approximately the same for the first and second half of september. The minimum flow value is very slightly lower within the first half of september, while the maximum flow value is several hundred cubic feet higher than the second half of september. The first half of september has more variation, or more extremes, than the second half of september according to the period of record used for this homework (1981 to current).

#### Forecast Explanation
My forecast values were based on the current conditions and GFS height anomalies over the northeast areas of Arizona. There are a few low pressure systems that are forecasted but very low moisture content over the next two weeks, except for a day or two towards the end of this week.
