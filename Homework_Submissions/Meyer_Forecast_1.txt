I based my streamflow guesses on a broader or long-term pattern during the end of August and early September, and then again on very recent patterns over the past two months. I also assume there is going to be more precipitation within the next week or so due to synoptic patterns shifting. However, the potential precipitation that may occur will be offset heavily by the very low current daily means.
